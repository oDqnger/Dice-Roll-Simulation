# Dice-Roll-Simulation
A small python program that rolls a dice. This is an extremeley easy project to make, mainly targeted towards absolute beginners who have just learnt the basics of python. I have made it a little advanced by shortening the code, adding extra details and making it more efficient. If you are up for a challenge, try calculating the frequency and relative frequency and display the stats after they have rolled the dices.

# How to download
To play, make sure you have python 3+ installed, then you need to download the main.py file and place it anywhere in your computer. Then, go to your cmd (terminal for mac or linux users) and then navigate to the folder path using "cd [insert folder name here, dont include the brackets]. Once you are in the folder where the main.py file is stored, run the py file by typing, "python main.py."
